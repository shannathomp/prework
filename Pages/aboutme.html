     </div>
      <p>One thing about me is that I love a good tv show. My favorite shows consists of a few actually. I love to watch comedy shows, shows about law, and comic and action shows. My favorite of them all would be Golden Girls, and the Equalizer.
         <br>
         <p>Golden Girls is considered one of my favorites because its full of comedy. I love the way that they roast each other, but at the same time they show each other love. At the end of the day they ride for each other, and that's the true definition of friends to me.</p>
